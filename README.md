# Defender-DevOps-Pipeline-Scanner

Standardize secure pipeline scanning and centralize actionable results in Defender for DevOps.

## Example synopsis

A pipeline scan request produces a tenant-scoped plan for IaC and container analysis with read-only CI permissions, secretless Azure reporting, and deterministic evidence.

## Real-world scenario

Security findings are spread across build logs and discovered after deployment. This blueprint brings standardized scanning into pull requests and forwards actionable results into Defender for DevOps for one operational view.

## Architecture

Reusable GitHub Actions and Azure DevOps templates run secret, IaC, dependency, and container scans, normalize SARIF, annotate pull requests, publish security evidence, and connect supported findings to Defender.

Primary services: `Defender for Cloud`, `Microsoft Security DevOps`, `GitHub Actions`, `Azure DevOps`.

This repository implements the first production-oriented vertical slice: a
fail-closed, adapter-neutral control plane that validates tenant scope,
freshness, approvals, secretless identity, private access, and the exact
project action before producing a deterministic execution plan. Azure adapters
consume that plan; they are deliberately outside the local simulator so local
tests cannot claim a live cloud change occurred.

```

## Quickstart

Requirements: Python 3.11+ and Git. No Azure credentials are required.

```bash
./scripts/validate.sh
python3 src/control_plane.py --request examples/approved-request.json
```

The command emits canonical JSON with a stable idempotency key. The denied
fixture exits with status 2 and explains the failed invariants.

## Security boundaries

- Managed identity or workload identity only; embedded credentials are denied.
- Public network access and stale evidence are denied.
- Production and break-glass targets require explicit approval.
- The IaC entry point is opt-in and defaults to deploying nothing.
- Evidence output contains identifiers and decisions, never credential values.

## Verification and limitations

Local validation covers 13 tests, deterministic replay, JSON parsing, Python
compilation, ignore hygiene, and Bicep compilation when a compiler is present.
It does **not** prove Azure deployment, service licensing, quota, data-plane
permissions, provider/API availability, cloud failover, load, cost, or teardown.
